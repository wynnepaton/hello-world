Sharing learning resources as I learn

Hi!

I'm currently learning Python, C, SQL (have done Code Academy Learn SQL and am now onto a Teach Yourself book), HTML, CSS and JS.  

Is there a website that recommends coding resources and plans for different learning styles?

A list of learning styles:

Visual 
Aural 
Verbal 
Social 
Logical 
Physical & tactile 
Solitary 
Naturalist 

Is there a questionairre which helps identify your learning style and then recommends coding resources or suggestions to learn in the most effective way?
