Sharing learning resources as I learn

Hi!

I'm currently learning Python, C, SQL (have done Code Academy Learn SQL and am now onto a Teach Yourself book), HTML, CSS and JS.  

***Current sticking point is learning what all parts of C code actually does. I've watched lots of videos but still 'just don't get it'

e.g. (From Harvards CS50: meow3.c

1 // Abstraction with parameterization 
2
3 #include <stdio.h>
4
5 void meow(int n); 
6
7 int main(void) 
8 {
9  meow(3);                //does this mean meow 3 times?  Looks like nothing would print.
10 }
11
12  // Meow some number of times
13. void meow(int n)
14 }
15 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {.          // What does this mean? i can be 0, i can be less than n and i can be ++ , i+1? OR infinitly incremented?
16
17  printf("meow\n"); }.                  //This looks like "meow" would print once and go to a new line...?
18}
19


What does ++ mean?
What does void meow(int n);      do?

Is there a website that recommends coding resources and plans for different learning styles?

A list of learning styles:

Visual 
Aural 
Verbal 
Social 
Logical 
Physical & tactile 
Solitary 
Naturalist 

Is there a questionairre which helps identify your learning style and then recommends coding resources or suggestions to learn in the most effective way?
